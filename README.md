## Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React 19 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **UI Library**: Material-UI (MUI) v6
- **Charts**: Recharts for data visualization
- **AI Integration**: Google Generative AI (Gemini API)
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage (default) or SQLite backend (optional)
- **Backend**: Express.js + SQLite (optional, see Backend Setup)
- **Date Handling**: date-fns

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm or pnpm
- Google Gemini API key (optional, for AI features)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd "SLP Caseload Tracker"
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
```

3. Install API dependencies (first time only):
```bash
cd api
npm install
cd ..
```

4. Start the development servers (both frontend and API):
```bash
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
```

This will start both:
- **Frontend** on `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in the terminal)
- **API Server** on `http://localhost:3001`

5. Open your browser and navigate to the frontend URL shown in the terminal

### Configuration

1. **Gemini API Key** (for AI features):
   - Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Open Settings in the app
   - Enter your API key
   - The key is stored locally and never sent to any server except Google's Gemini API

### Backend Setup (Optional)

The app now supports an optional Express + SQLite backend for more robust data storage:

1. **Set up the backend**:
   ```bash
   cd api
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Migrate your data** (if you have existing localStorage data):
   - See [MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](./MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions
   - Export your localStorage data first
   - Run the migration script to import into SQLite

3. **Update frontend to use API**:
   - Change imports from `'./utils/storage'` to `'./utils/storage-api'` in your components
   - Or keep using localStorage if you prefer

The backend provides:
- ✅ More reliable data storage (SQLite database)
- ✅ Better performance for large datasets
- ✅ Easy backups (just copy the .db file)
- ✅ Export/import endpoints
- ✅ All CRUD operations via REST API

See the [API README](./api/README.md) for more details.

## Usage

### Getting Started

1. **Add Students**: Navigate to the Students page and click "Add Student" to create student profiles
2. **Create Goals**: Open a student's detail page and add goals with baseline and target performance levels
3. **Log Sessions**: Use the Sessions page to document therapy sessions, track performance, and record activities
4. **Track Progress**: View detailed progress charts and generate progress notes in the Progress page
5. **Generate Ideas**: Use the Treatment Ideas page to get AI-generated activity suggestions based on goal areas and age ranges

### Data Backup

Regularly export your data through Settings > Export/Import Data to create backups. This is especially important since data is stored locally in your browser.
