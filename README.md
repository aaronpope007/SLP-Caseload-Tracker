## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm or pnpm
- Google Gemini API key (optional, for AI features)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd "SLP Caseload Tracker"
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
```

3. Install API dependencies:
```bash
cd api
npm install
cd ..
```

4. Start the development servers (both frontend and API are required):
```bash
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
```

This will automatically start both:
- **Frontend** on `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in the terminal)
- **API Server** on `http://localhost:3001`

> **Note**: Both servers must be running for the app to function. The `pnpm dev` command uses `concurrently` to start both servers automatically.

5. Open your browser and navigate to the frontend URL shown in the terminal

6. The SQLite database will be automatically created at `api/data/slp-caseload.db` on first run

### Configuration

1. **Gemini API Key** (for AI features):
   - Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Open Settings in the app
   - Enter your API key
   - The key is stored locally and never sent to any server except Google's Gemini API

### First Time Setup - Explore with Test Data

**New to the app?** You can quickly explore all features with sample test data:

1. **Open Settings**: Click the Settings icon (⚙️) in the navigation bar
2. **Go to Test Data Section**: Scroll down to the "Test Data" section
3. **Create Test Data**: Click "Create Test Data" to automatically generate:
   - **Test Elementary School** - A sample school
   - **6 Teachers** - One teacher for each grade (Kindergarten through 5th Grade)
   - **18 Students** - Three students per grade (Student A, B, and C) with:
     - Age-appropriate ages (5-10 years old)
     - Sample concerns (Articulation, Language)
     - Linked to their grade teacher
     - Active status

4. **Explore the App**: Once test data is created, you can:
   - Browse students and see how they're organized
   - Add goals to test students
   - Log therapy sessions
   - Try all the features with realistic sample data
   - Delete test data anytime from Settings when you're ready to add your real data

> **Note**: Test data can be deleted at any time from Settings > Test Data > Delete Test Data. This will remove all test students, teachers, and the test school.

### Backend Details

The app uses an Express + SQLite backend for data storage:

- **Database Location**: `api/data/slp-caseload.db`
- **Backups Location**: `api/data/backups/`
- **Automatic Setup**: The database is created automatically on first run
- **API Documentation**: Available at `http://localhost:3001/api-docs`

The backend provides:

- ✅ Better performance for large datasets
- ✅ Database backup & restore via UI
- ✅ Export/import endpoints
- ✅ All CRUD operations via REST API
- ✅ Full-featured API for all data types
- ✅ Rate limiting and input validation
- ✅ Optional authentication

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the `api` folder to configure the backend:

```env
# Server
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3001

# Authentication (disabled by default in development)
AUTH_ENABLED=false
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-change-in-production
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d

# CORS (allow all origins in development)
CORS_ORIGIN=*

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100

# Backups
MAX_BACKUPS=10

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

See the [API README](./api/README.md) for complete API documentation.

## Usage

2. **Explore Features**: Try adding goals, logging sessions, and exploring all the features
3. **Delete Test Data**: When ready, delete test data from Settings and add your real students

**Option 2: Start with Your Own Data**
1. **Add a School**: Navigate to Schools page and create your first school
2. **Add Teachers**: Add teachers for each school (optional, but helpful for organization)
3. **Add Students**: Navigate to the Students page and click "Add Student" to create student profiles
4. **Create Goals**: Open a student's detail page and add goals with baseline and target performance levels
5. **Log Sessions**: Use the Sessions page to document therapy sessions, track performance, and record activities
6. **Track Progress**: View detailed progress charts and generate progress notes in the Progress page
7. **Generate Ideas**: Use the Treatment Ideas page to get AI-generated activity suggestions based on goal areas and age ranges

### Data Backup

**Automatic Backup**: Your data is automatically saved to the SQLite database at `api/data/slp-caseload.db`. Simply copy this file to create a backup.

**Export Data**: You can also export your data through Settings > Export/Import Data or use the API export endpoint:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/export/all > backup.json
```

**Recommended**: Regularly copy the database file (`api/data/slp-caseload.db`) to a safe location for backups.
